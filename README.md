# Sports Club Management
A school project where I've been asked to create a Pyhton Program for managing a Sports Club.
So basically it includes functions such as registering a new member, auto assigning them codes, calculating their yearly fees etc.
Bear with me I'm just student and my code might not be the best or efficent but its all coded by me and its my ideas.

# Certain requiremnets before running the program
Install the the Python Library "Tabulate" in the Python Scripts directory using the command ```pip install tabulate```

Copy the folder **_projectmodules** to the Python Lib directory

I have provided a Member, Facility and a Fees file , make sure to keep it in the same folder as **Sports Club Management.py**
