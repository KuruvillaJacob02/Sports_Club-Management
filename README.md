# Sports_Club_Management
A school project where I've been asked to create a Pyhton Program for a Sports Club Managment
So basically it includes functions such as registering a new member, auto assigning them codes, calculating their yearly fees etc
The file called Sports Club Management.py contains the main code which includes all the menus and options
The file project.py contains all the major functions and modules which is the heart of the program
Bear with me I'm just student and my code might not be the best or efficent but its all coded by me and its my ideas.
